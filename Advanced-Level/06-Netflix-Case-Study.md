## 🔥 **High-Level System Architecture**  

📌 **Netflix follows a microservices-based architecture:**  

```plaintext
[User] → [API Gateway] → [Microservices Layer] → [Content Delivery Network (CDN)]
✅ Microservices Handle Different Tasks:
1️⃣ User Service – Authentication, subscriptions.
2️⃣ Catalog Service – Stores movie metadata, genres.
3️⃣ Recommendation Service – AI-powered content suggestions.
4️⃣ Playback Service – Handles video streaming requests.
5️⃣ Billing Service – Manages payments and subscriptions.

🔥 How Netflix Streams Video Efficiently
📌 1. Content Delivery Network (CDN) – Open Connect
Netflix uses CDN caching to reduce latency and improve speed.

✅ What is a CDN?
A CDN caches content on multiple servers worldwide, closer to users.

✅ Netflix’s CDN (Open Connect):

Stores popular movies/TV shows in regional Edge Servers.

Reduces load on the main Netflix data centers.

Ensures low latency, high-speed streaming.

📌 Example Flow:
1️⃣ A user in India requests "Stranger Things."
2️⃣ Instead of fetching from a US data center, Netflix serves the video from a local edge server in India.
3️⃣ This reduces latency and improves buffering speed.

📌 2. Video Encoding & Adaptive Bitrate Streaming
Netflix supports different video resolutions (240p, 480p, 720p, 1080p, 4K) based on internet speed.

✅ How Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) Works?

A slow connection → Netflix delivers lower resolution (480p).

A fast connection → Netflix delivers higher resolution (1080p or 4K).

📌 Tech Used:

FFmpeg for video encoding.

MPEG-DASH & HLS protocols for streaming.

🔥 Netflix’s Data Storage Strategy
Netflix uses a combination of SQL and NoSQL databases for efficient data handling.

Service	Database Used	Why?
User Data	Amazon RDS (MySQL)	Consistent & relational data storage
Movie Metadata	Cassandra	NoSQL for scalability
Watch History	DynamoDB	Fast retrieval
Logs & Analytics	Apache Kafka	Real-time streaming
✅ Why NoSQL (Cassandra) for Movie Data?

Netflix needs to store and query millions of records quickly.

NoSQL provides horizontal scaling and high availability.

🔥 How Netflix Handles User Recommendations
Netflix uses AI & Machine Learning to provide personalized recommendations.

📌 How does it work?
1️⃣ User watches a movie → Generates viewing data.
2️⃣ Recommendation Engine (AI Model) processes the data.
3️⃣ Personalized movie suggestions are displayed on the homepage.

✅ Netflix’s AI Techniques:

Collaborative Filtering – Suggests shows based on similar users.

Content-Based Filtering – Recommends based on genre, actors.

Deep Learning (Neural Networks) – Analyzes past viewing habits.

📌 Example:

If you watch “Breaking Bad”, Netflix may suggest “Better Call Saul” based on user preferences.

🔥 Microservices & Event-Driven Architecture
Netflix follows a microservices architecture with event-driven communication using Kafka.

📌 Example:

A user starts a new subscription → The Billing Service notifies other services via Kafka events.

Email Service listens to the event and sends a confirmation email.

✅ Advantages of Microservices:

Scalability – Each service scales independently.

Fault Isolation – If one service fails, others continue running.

Better Deployment – Netflix uses Spinnaker for fast rollouts.

🔥 Netflix Fault Tolerance & High Availability
Netflix operates without downtime using:

✅ Chaos Engineering (Simian Army)

Netflix intentionally breaks its own system to test failures.

Chaos Monkey randomly shuts down servers to test resiliency.

✅ Load Balancing & Auto-Scaling

Netflix uses AWS Auto Scaling to add/remove servers dynamically based on demand.

Global Load Balancers ensure traffic is routed to healthy instances.

✅ Disaster Recovery & Multi-Region Strategy

Netflix runs services in multiple AWS regions.

If one region fails, traffic is redirected to another region.

📌 Example:

If US-East AWS data center goes down, Netflix reroutes traffic to US-West without downtime.

🔥 Netflix Security Best Practices
✅ OAuth 2.0 & JWT for secure authentication.
✅ HTTPS Everywhere – Encrypts all API communication.
✅ DDoS Protection – Uses AWS Shield against attacks.
✅ Data Encryption – Protects user data at rest and in transit.
✅ Rate Limiting – Prevents abuse of APIs.
