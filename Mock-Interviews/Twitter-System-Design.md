🔹 Scenario
Interviewer: Design a scalable system for Twitter, focusing on tweet posting, feed generation, and handling millions of users in real-time.

🔹 Step 1: Clarifying Questions
(These questions help you define the problem scope.)

✅ What are the core features?

Posting tweets (text, images, videos).

Generating a user feed (followers’ tweets).

Like, retweet, and comment functionality.

Scalability to handle millions of users.

✅ Read vs. Write ratio?

Twitter is read-heavy (users mostly view tweets).

Writes are less frequent than reads.

✅ Real-time or eventual consistency?

Users expect low latency for feed updates.

We can use eventual consistency for scalability.

🔹 Step 2: High-Level Design
🔥 Architecture Diagram (Describe or Draw)
1️⃣ Clients (Mobile, Web) → API Gateway
2️⃣ Load Balancer → Microservices (Tweet Service, User Service, Feed Service)
3️⃣ Databases (SQL for user data, NoSQL for tweets & feeds)
4️⃣ Caching (Redis, Memcached) for fast retrieval
5️⃣ Message Queue (Kafka, RabbitMQ) for async processing

🔹 Step 3: Database Schema Design
📌 Users Table (SQL)
sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);
📌 Tweets Table (NoSQL - Cassandra)
json
Copy
Edit
{
    "tweet_id": "12345",
    "user_id": "789",
    "content": "Hello Twitter!",
    "timestamp": "2025-03-29T12:00:00Z"
}
📌 Follower Table (SQL - Many-to-Many)
sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TABLE followers (
    follower_id BIGINT,
    followee_id BIGINT,
    PRIMARY KEY (follower_id, followee_id)
);
🔹 Step 4: Handling High Traffic & Scalability
✅ Caching Popular Tweets → Store in Redis
✅ Sharding Strategy → Shard tweets by user_id % N
✅ Asynchronous Processing → Use Kafka for feed updates
✅ CDN (Cloudflare, AWS CloudFront) → Serve media files

🔹 Step 5: Feed Generation (Pull vs. Push)
📌 Push Model (Fan-out on write) → Precompute feeds when a user tweets (Faster but expensive).
📌 Pull Model (Fan-in on read) → Fetch tweets dynamically when a user opens Twitter (Slower but scalable).
✅ Hybrid Model → Push for VIP users, Pull for normal users.

🔹 Step 6: API Design
🚀 Post a Tweet API
http
Copy
Edit
POST /tweets
{
    "user_id": "123",
    "content": "Hello World!"
}
🚀 Get User Feed API
http
Copy
Edit
GET /feed?user_id=123
🔹 Step 7: Interview Questions & Challenges
✅ How do you handle trending tweets efficiently?
✅ What happens if a tweet goes viral?
✅ How to prevent spam & abuse on Twitter?
✅ How to handle sudden traffic spikes (e.g., celebrity tweets)?

🎯 Final Thoughts
✅ Explain trade-offs (Push vs. Pull, SQL vs. NoSQL).
✅ Use diagrams to showcase architecture.
✅ Think about edge cases (deleting tweets, private accounts).
